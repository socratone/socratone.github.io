# Epica - Storm The Sorrow

Along the way, I find myself\
To be confined within me\
No place for any other's mind to interfere\
To grasp the meaning of it all\
To overcome my limits\
And dance away from any void and empty tones

Just tell me why\
Just tell me how I can survive this time

Believe yourself and look away\
From all that's right within you\
Leave all your worries at the door and drift away\
I've tried to peer into the core\
But could not storm the sorrow\
My hollow heart has bled me dry, left me to stray

Another time (another time)\
Without a trace (without a trace)\
Condemn me now (condemn me now)\
Send me to hell, for I'm already failing\

Intertwine the lines that swim beneath the dark\
Realize the pain we live in\
Demonize the need we reel in, oh-oh-oh\
In my memories, I'll dig deep enough to know\
Centuries of dreams unending\
Another me that yielded tears when someone had betrayed

No time to ever go to waste\
It's not that complicated\
You're free to live your life at ease\
No more restraint\

No heed for shadows on your way\
That try to steal your laughter\
Your light will drive them all away\
Be confident

Will I refrain? (Will I refrain?)\
Can I repent? (Can I repent?)\
Will you be there? (Will you be there?)\
Erase the page, for I'm alone and ailing

Intertwine the lines that swim beneath the dark\
Realize the pain we live in\
Demonize the need we reel in, oh-oh-oh\
In my memories I'll dig deep enough to know\
Centuries of dreams unending\
Another me that yielded tears when someone had betrayed

So, this is my life, and it can't break me down\
Go\
I will decide who can come in and heal my disease\
Burn it in flames\
Kill it and maim\
Why can't you see that you need to be freed?

Intertwine the lines beneath the dark\
Every bit of pain we're feeling\
Every other solemn life, oh-oh-oh\
In the memories, you will find somehow\
There used to be a dream unending\
No more need to be alone

Intertwine the lines that swim beneath the dark\
Realize the pain we live in\
Demonize the need we reel in, oh-oh-oh\
In my memories, I'll dig deep enough to know\
Centuries of dreams unending\
Another me that yielded tears when someone had betrayed

Someone had betrayed
